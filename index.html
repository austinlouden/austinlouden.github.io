  <h2>Hey, I'm Austin. I'm on the product engineering team at Pinterest.</h2>
  <p>Currently, I build and maintain a set of features in the production iOS app.</p> 
  <p>Press about projects I've worked on: <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/pinterest-reinvents-prove-really-worth-billions/">Wired</a>,

  <h2>Formerly, I worked at a Chicago-based startup called StageBloc.</h2>
  <p><a href="https://stagebloc.com/">StageBloc</a> helps creators connect with their fans. I helped build and redesign their iPhone app for iOS 7. I also did some miscellaneous work to help with a relaunch of <a href="http://justintimberlake.com/">justintimberlake.com.</a></p>

  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <p>"Austin has just blown me away on every front! We got the project done with agressive deadlines and upper mangement couldn’t be happier with the result. Austin was a major and intricate part of that success. He’s humble, hungry, great attitude, cool under pressure, a thoughtful contributor but most importantly a really great person. Maybe to save time I can just say if I had my own company or one crew to get a job done I’d want him on it."</p>
  <p>– <a href="http://wilson.tv/">Jason Wilson</a>, former designer of <a href="http://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a></p> 

  <p>"It’s rare that you come across standout talent like Austin. He’s very interested and curious, amazing attitude when it comes to prototyping and hacking on ideas, and at the same time delivers well structured production ready code. Personally I think Austin is one of the few I trust, when it comes to really paying attention to the details in my designs. I was really amazed by his execution."</p>
